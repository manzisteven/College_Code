Instructions on how to use my program 

To use my program you can follow the following steps:
-	Use your favorite Java compiler to import the main.java and Data.java files available in the source folder (nested in the assignment5 folder)
-	Get the MovieData text file and place it in the same folder as the source folder.  
-	Once the program is compiled and executed, you will be prompted to enter the source actor and destination actor
-	After entering the name of actors, the result will be displayed 



Note: for testing my program, it is recommended to use the MovieData text file available in the assignment5 folder, 
since my code for parsing the file was tested using that exact text file. In fact, I made minor modifications to the file, 
the file had a line where there was a bracket ([) instead of a parenthesis, I changed this bracket to a parenthesis to preserve the format 
(ideally, I should have handled this in my code). If you use another text file you will definitively get stringOutOfBounds exception.
